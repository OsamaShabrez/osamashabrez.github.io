Hi there, I am just testing out how to put this github.io pages and [Jekyll](http://jekyll.com) together to make a blog. I have one previously at [OsamaShabrez.com](http://OsamaShabrez.com) powered by WordPress but I spend more time managing the backend stuff than keeping the blog updated. I feel this would be much simpler, easy to manage and use, hence increasing productivity.
